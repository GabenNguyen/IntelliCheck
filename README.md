## 📚 What I have learnt after this project
After this project, here are the things that I have learnt:
- **Real-world full-stack development process**: This project is a great way for me to learn the complete process of a full-stack web development.
- **Secure authentication**: I learnt how to secure user sign-in and sign-up process using ___Clerk___
- **Database design with Prisma**: This project taught me how to design the database and how to use Prisma ORM effectively.
- **Practical AI Integration**: Initially, I intended to make several question sets with specific topics like History, Art, Computer Science, etc. However, I found that it was static and boring so I decided to integrate Google Gemini AI into this project. This allows the website question setup process more dynamic as users can choose any topics they want, making it more engaging.
- **Modern UI/UX design**: The website pages at first were boring with simple design. Due to this issue, I started to learn some modern UI/UX design such as glassmorphism to make the pages more beautiful and attractive.

## 📈 Future Improvements
More features and functions for this project will be added in the future such as: 
- Analytics & leaderboard dashboard pages.
- Quizzes generated from PDF file.
- PDF export
- Streak counter
